# Graphs-for-optimization
(Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm) ðŸ“Œ Task: Develop a route planner for a cityâ€™s public transport system
Use a graph where nodes = bus/train stations, edges = travel times.
Implement Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to find the shortest route between two locations. 
Bonus: Allow real-time traffic updates (adjust edge weights dynamically). 
ðŸ”¹ Real-world relevance: Used in Google Maps, Waze, and GPS navigation.
